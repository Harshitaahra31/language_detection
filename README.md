Welcome to the Language Detection Project, this project aims to create a language detection model capable of accurately discerning the language of any given text input. Utilizing a carefully curated dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing 17 languages including English, Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Dutch, Arabic, Turkish, German, Danish, and Greek, our model is primed to provide accurate predictions. By harnessing the power of Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and string, we undertake meticulous data preprocessing and model training to ensure the utmost precision. This project is poised to revolutionize cross-lingual communication and contribute to a deeper understanding of linguistic diversity.
